This repository provides the code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the accompanying paper. 
Specifically, the file `FGDI_Paper_Parkinsons.R` contains the analysis of the Parkinson's disease dataset, 
while `FGDI_Paper_Amputee.R` focuses on the analysis of the amputee dataset. 

The primary function used to compute the Functional Gait Deviation Index (FGDI) across these 
analyses is implemented in the `FGDIF.R` file.
